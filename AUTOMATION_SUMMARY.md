# 🚀 School Photos Automation - Complete Setup

## ✅ What We've Built

Your school photo downloader is now **fully automated** and will run every Friday at 7:00 PM EST to automatically download and upload school photos to Google Photos!

## 📁 Files Created

### GitHub Actions
- **`.github/workflows/school-photos.yml`** - Automated workflow that runs every Friday
- **`GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions
- **`setup_github_secrets.py`** - Helper script to format secrets for GitHub

### Documentation
- **`AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary file
- **Updated `README.md`** - Added GitHub Actions section

### Security
- **`.gitignore`** - Prevents sensitive files from being committed to GitHub

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions automation for school photos"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets
Run the helper script to see exactly what secrets to add:
```bash
python3 setup_github_secrets.py
```

Then add these 4 secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `EMAIL_USERNAME`
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` 
- `SENDER_EMAIL`
- `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_CREDENTIALS`

### 3. Test the Workflow
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Find "School Photos Downloader" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" to test manually

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Execution
- **When**: Every Friday at 7:00 PM EST (midnight UTC on Saturday)
- **What**: Downloads photos from school emails and uploads to Google Photos
- **Where**: Runs on GitHub's cloud servers (no need for your computer to be on)

### Manual Testing
- You can trigger the workflow manually anytime
- Perfect for testing or if you want to check for photos on other days

### Monitoring
- Check the "Actions" tab in GitHub to see if it ran successfully
- Green checkmark = success, red X = failure
- Download logs if you need to troubleshoot

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ All sensitive data stored as GitHub Secrets
- ✅ Credentials only used during workflow execution
- ✅ All sensitive files cleaned up after each run
- ✅ Logs don't contain sensitive information
- ✅ `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits of secrets

## 📊 Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:
1. **GitHub Actions**: Green checkmark for successful runs
2. **Google Photos**: New photos appear in your library every Friday
3. **Logs**: "Successfully uploaded X photos to Google Photos main library"

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Hands-off**: Never need to manually download photos again
- **Reliable**: Runs even if your computer is off
- **Monitored**: See success/failure status in GitHub
- **Flexible**: Can run manually anytime for testing
- **Secure**: All credentials stored safely in GitHub Secrets
